                "Do you know what I was, how I lived? 
                You know what despair is; then
                winter should have meaning for you. 
                
                I did not expect to survive, 
                earth suppressing me. I didn't expect 
                to waken again, to feel 
                in damp earth my body 
                able to respond again, remembering 
                after so long how to open again 
                in the cold light 
                of the earliest spring--- 
                
                afraid, yes, but among you again 
                crying yes risk joy 

                in the raw wind of the new world." - Gluck, Page 6

                "Look at the night sky:
                I have two selves, two kinds of power.

                I am here with you, at the window, 
                watching you react. Yesterday
                the moon rose over moist earth in the lower garden.
                Now the earth glitters like the moon, 
                like dead matter crusted with light.

                You can close your eyes now.
                I have heard your cries, and cries before yours,
                and the demand behind them.
                I have shown you what you want:
                not belief, but capitulation
                to authority, which depends on violence." - Gluck, Page 9

                "Not I, you idiot, not self, but we, we-- waves
                of sky blue like
                a critique of heaven: why
                do you treasure your voice
                when to be one thing
                is to be the next to nothing?
                Why do you look up? To hear an echo like the voice
                of god? You are all the same to us,
                solitary, standing above us, planning 
                your silly lives: you go
                where you are sent, like all things, 
                where the wind plants you,
                one or another of you forever
                looking down and seeing some image 
                of water, and hearing what? Waves,
                and over waves, birds singing." - Gluck, Page 14

            <h3>Snowdrop</h3>
            <p>
                This poem is very motivating and moving to me. To think that when everyting in the world is trying to bring you down and that the odds are against you, that in the end everything will be okay and you will always wake up to a new day, in a new world.

            <h3>Spring Snow</h3>
            <p>
                This poem was very hard to decypher and understand for me. From what I can understand, being free in the world requires a lot of effort and tears in order to achieve. This is something that many of us take for granted while other people in other parts of the world have to resort to voilence against authority in order to achieve this level of relative freedom.

            <h3>Scilla</h3>
            <p>
                Although to me this poem had no direct message, the flower had a very strong tone with a very negative view towards humans and how we live our lives. Although the flower is literally planted underneath our feet, metaphorically the flower is looking down on us.
